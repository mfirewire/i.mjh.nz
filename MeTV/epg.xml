    <title>The Three Stooges</title>
    <sub-title>Punch Drunks, Horses' Collars, From Nurse To Worse, All The World's A Stooge, Cactus Makes Perfect, I Can Hardly Wait</sub-title>
    <desc>"Moe is a boxing promoter looking for a good fighter.  , The Stooges are private detectives in the old West trying to help a girl recover an IOU from a bad guy.   , The Stooges are defense workers who have trouble getting to sleep when Curly gets a toothache.  Moe and Larry try various ways to remove the offending tooth, but nothing works so they take Curly to the dentist.  While Moe gets in the chair to show Curly how easy it's going to be, the dentist enters and pulls Moe's tooth by mistake.  Curly then wakes up and realizes its all been a dream and a punch to the mouth from Moe dislodges the tooth. , The stooge's friend Jerry convinces them to take out on insurance on Curly and then have him act insane to collect.  Moe and Larry put Curly on a leash and take him to the insurance doctor and have him act like a dog.  Unfortunately, the insurance doctor wants to perform a brain operation (Cerebrum decapitation).  The boys try to escape by hiding in the dog catchers wagon, but are caught and taken to the hospital.  They escape again, this time by rigging a sheet to a gurney and sailing down the street, where they run into Jerry and knock him into wet cement. , The Stooges are window washers who lose their jobs after Moe impersonates the dentist in whose office they were cleaning.  On the run, they are hired by a millionaire to pose as children.  It seems the man's wife wants to adopt some refugees to impress her society friends.  Moe is Johnny, Curly is Frankie and Larry is Mabel.  Everything goes fairly well as the lady shows off the Stooges to her friends, but they finally irritate her husband so much that he goes after them with an ax. , The Stooges are living with their mother who persuades them its time to leave home and seek their fortune.  After a con man sells them a phony deed to a lost gold mine, the boys head west to find the treasure.  After some mishaps with Curly's gold finding invention, they locate the mine and strike it rich.  When two crooked miners try to take their gold they hole up in an abandoned hotel and, although they get bombarded by dynamite, triumph over the crooks. "</desc>

These days, Henry is a well known collector of TV costumes and props, so having Lisa Whelchel in his home and being able to show her something she may have worn on Facts of Life, which is coincidentally, one of Henry's alltime favorite shows,  was definitely a "pinch me" moment for our collector. A Laverne &amp; Shirley skirt, a Peg Bundy top and a Carol Burnett dress are just a few of the iconic TV costumes Henry's managed to get his hands on. You might recognize our expert Stewart, as one of our collectors' from last season and someone with his own impressive collection of TV costumes and props.Stewart appraises Henry's collection and brings along one of his special costumes in the hopes that Henry will want to make a trade."</desc>
