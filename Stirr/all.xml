With a total trajectory of nearly 1,000km and a route that had to be thought and rethought due to wind direction, shark infested waters, and distances that push this athlete to his limit, sweat will flow and his nerves will surely be put to the test.Mitu’s maverick journey across marvellous Atlantic waters and beaches, through inhospitable lunar landscapes and the lush vegetation of the volcanic islands is truly a SURFARI on a kite.

    <title>Cape Verdean Kite Crossing</title>
    <desc>Mitu Monteiro, a Cape Verdean kitesurfer and multi-time world champion, attempts the solo crossing of the twelve volcanic islands of his native archipelago, never accomplished before.Taking on more than 730km of kitesurfing, interspersed with island traverses by only man-powered means totalling approximately 200km, Mitu’s challenges lay ahead of him. With a total trajectory of nearly 1,000km and a route that had to be thought and rethought due to wind direction, shark infested waters, and distances that push this athlete to his limit, sweat will flow and his nerves will surely be put to the test.Mitu’s maverick journey across marvellous Atlantic waters and beaches, through inhospitable lunar landscapes and the lush vegetation of the volcanic islands is truly a SURFARI on a kite. Relive the whole experience on Nautical Channel.</desc>

    <title>Tahitian Swell</title>
    <desc>The French Polynesia is world famous not only for its clear blue waters, but also for the quality of its waves to the delight of worldwide surfers. These waves are generated by the swell; an undulating movement of the sea surface that advances as it does not break.If the French Polynesia is one of the kingdoms of surfing, it is thanks to its geographical location. Nestled in the heart of the South Pacific, this group of five archipelagos cover an area as vast as Europe and benefit all year round from swells generated by the four winds.The conditions are therefore ideal for the many wave lovers: surfers, windsurfers, bodyboarders... but in order for them to enjoy these conditions, knowledge of marine forecasting is essential. This is where the Polynesian branch of Météo France takes place, including amongst their team swell specialists as Kenji Flohr, a Polynesian forecaster and surfer.His mission is to anticipate the waves that will break on the Polynesian coasts, by analysing the swells, their direction, period, energy, length, and dimensions. The expertise of this surfer forecaster enables to popularize a set of advanced analyses. This makes this didactic documentary accessible to all. And thanks to Kenji Flohr’s crystal clear explanations like the water of the Pacific Ocean, this complex system becomes clear and above all… fascinating.Learn more about the Tahitian Swell and the scientific approach for predicting waves, available on Nautical Channel.</desc>

The founders of FiveOceans give ocean rubbish a new life, using plastic collected from the Indian Ocean, proving it is possible to close the cycle with ocean waste and high quality surf gear.In this stunning documentary, they prove their mission and reveal a transparent value chain of the waste material to design a performance product for surfers. With their background in engineering, the unrivalled story is underlined by surfing, adventure and great personalities as the two friends battle their way to achieve a much higher goal: reducing the plastic that ends up in the oceans they surf.</desc>
